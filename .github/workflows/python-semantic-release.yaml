      # Note: due to branch protection rules (e.g., 'Require a pull request before merging'), the
      # standard `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks permission to create commits on the main branch. To
      # enable `python-semantic-release` to act on main, we utilize a token generated by an app
      # with read and write permissions for contents, which is on the bypass list of the respective
      # ruleset. See also: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow#authenticating-with-a-github-app
